    <h1>Website Templates</h1>
    <p>These are a compilation of website templates which I have designed for myself and other people. I have redacted all information on these pages and replaced with
    samples. As you can see, I enjoy doing older styles of web design while employing modern CSS.</p>

         <p>Website template I made for an artist friend of mine. She sketched it out and gave me feedback while I implemented it.
